## How the commits are made
1. process: used just to update the code with no change in mind
2. feat: made a change relating to a feature of some sort
3. bugFix: fixed a bug that might have been pushed with prior with the current commit

### current issues i'm facing
- the not coming soon route is being triggered instead of the notFound component i set in the main.tsx
- second
- third
