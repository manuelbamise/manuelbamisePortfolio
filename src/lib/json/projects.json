    "longerText": "InspoForge is a content repurposing tool that helps users generate high-performing posts and video titles inspired by existing content. The core idea is to allow creators to input a popular tweet, blog title, or video headline, and the software analyzes it to generate similarly styled content tailored to the user's niche or audience. Features include post-style mimicry and headline inspiration tools for platforms like YouTube and X (formerly Twitter). This project deepens my experience in natural language processing, prompt engineering, and UX optimization for content creators. This projects is also a work in progress."

Originally intended to process text-based resources, the project has undergone several iterations. I'm currently building an image-processing feature that allows users to simply upload a picture of a resource, which the system will analyze and enhance automatically. Though still a work in progress, Pass has been a major learning milestone in my full-stack development journey, teaching me about system architecture, file handling, and improving user experience with automation."
